# What would YOU like to hear about in an rOpenSci Community Call? 

We are soliciting your "votes" and new ideas for [Community Call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/) topics and speakers. Read on to see how you can influence us. 

rOpenSci holds Community Calls every 1 - 2 months to share knowledge that is relevant to our community and consistent with [our vision and mission](https://ropensci.org/about/). These are free and open for anyone to attend and provide opportunities for us to connect with rOpenSci community members around the world.

Community Calls are 1 hour long, typically include presentations from 1 to 3 speakers and we always reserve 20 minutes for Q & A. [Past topics](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/) included, How do you review code that accompanies a research project or paper?, Security for R, How do I Create a Code of Conduct for my Event/Lab/Codebase?, and Research Applications of rOpenSci Taxonomy and Biodiversity Tools.

## How can you weigh in?

We’ve [opened an issue in this repository for each topic we’re considering](https://github.com/ropensci-org/community-calls/issues). We'd like your input and "votes" on these, and your suggestions for other topics we haven't though of. We welcome participation and civil conversations that adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/).

Watch this repo to see what people are saying.

## The template for suggesting a topic

We created an issue template so anyone can describe their idea for us and others to understand and weigh in. Make your suggestion by opening a new issue that includes:

- Topic
- Who is the audience? (_Who might want to know this? What other groups or organizations might be interested?_)
- Why is this important?
- What should be covered?
- Suggested speakers or contributors (consider people other than “the usual suspects”; being named here does not obligate them to participate in any way)
- Resources you would recommend to the audience

We will label issues with `0/idea`, `1/approved`, `2/working on it`, `3/completed`. 

## Thank you!
We'll use your input to prioritize and arrange future Community Calls.
